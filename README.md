## Group 2: Team <3

## Our Mission
Rainbow is a INFO 442 project designed to address the UN’s Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) of Quality Education. We offer a solution to the problem of colorblind children not having access to resources that help them learn about color at school and at home by creating an educational tool that will provide the appropriate support.

**Problem Statement: How might we support kids with color blindness and their families to help raise self esteem and confidence during their early childhood education?**

Inspired by: [A non-profit organization based in the UK](https://colorblindawareness.org/)
